Hello. This is a sample page of text with instructions to add to the server.
Position your body with your arms straight out, abs tight, holding your body in a plank position.
Hands and arms should be positioned slightly below your shoulders, fingers pointed forwards. Shoulders are pushed down away from your ears.
Lower your body until your chest is an inch or two above the floor, elbows pulling back at roughly a 45 degree angle.
Push your torso away from the ground until your arms lock, then repeat.
